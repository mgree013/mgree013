- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mgree013
- Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in the Kurt E. Anderson lab at UC Riverside in the  Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology Program (EEOB) studying aquatic community ecology. I use a variety of tools from Data Science and Visualization, Multivariate and Time Series Analysis, GIS, Laboratory Experiments, and Field Work to understand how the underlying spatial structure of habitats influence community dynamics and diversity. I'm passionate about Ecology and communicating complex data to a diversity of audiences.
