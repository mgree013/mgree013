### Welcome to my GitHub, I'm Matthew Green!

- I recently completed my Ph.D. in Kurt Anderson's lab from UC Riverside in the  Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology Program (EEOB) studying aquatic community ecology. Now, I'm working for General Motors on some exciting projects related to electric vehicles and unfortunately, that code and data isnt publically available. So most of these repos are focused on my ecological and publically available work from my PhD, but I'll add relevant things when work  permits!

- All Repos here are in R, but I'm also turning into a bigger Python and Spark fan these days. Most of the Repos here fall into a few broad categories of stats: Time Series Analyses, Multivariate Analyses, Some Forms of Mixed Models (GLMs, GLMMs,etc..), Spatial Analyses, Network Analysis, among others.
