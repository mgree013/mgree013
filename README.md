- I recently completed my Ph.D. in Kurt Anderson's lab from UC Riverside in the  Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology Program (EEOB) studying aquatic community ecology. Now, I'm working for General Motors on some exciting projects related to electric vehicles and unfortnatley, that code and data isnt publically available. So most of these repos are focused on my ecological and publically available work from my PhD, but I'll add relevant things when work  permits!

I use a variety of tools from Data Science and Visualization, Multivariate and Time Series Analysis, GIS, Laboratory Experiments, and Field Work to understand how the underlying spatial structure of habitats influence community dynamics and diversity. I'm passionate about Ecology and communicating complex data to a diversity of audiences.
